  <description>Tribbles are small, loveable, useless creatures that reproduce asexually. They will sneak in, bond with everyone and eat all your food. Try to keep their population under control.
  
  There will be no announcement when tribbles join your colony, or when they reproduce. They eat almost anything and ignore all zone restrictions. 
  
  Tribbles will sometimes be offered for sale by traders.
  
  Safe to add mid-game, removing it may cause trouble.
